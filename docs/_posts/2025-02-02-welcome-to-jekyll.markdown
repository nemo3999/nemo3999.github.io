## Why am I here ??
Well ... I officially started this blog in February 2025.
The idea is that by journaling my progress of learning here, I can build momentum to learn more ...
Why, here are the potential benefits I projected:
- I get to have nice documentation for complex ideas for future reference at the tip of my fingers
- Learning won't be so lonely anymore with a mind that these online documentations might be useful someday for someone (hopefully not some creepy kids who just wanna stalk my profile after 200 years)
- I get to practice my coding skills more even when I 'm not working lol
- I love markdown-styled notes, and I love to visualize complex ideas into way my primitve human brain can understand
- I guess I just couldn't find motivation to study after graduating from university...
- I am definitely not a genius, but I hope I canst someone hoping to contribute to something meaningful for humanity. I hope we don't go extinct. Haha.
